        The Odd Sheep was born out of rebellion—a quiet one, in a corner café in Bahrain. 
        What began as a sketch quickly grew into a creative movement for the bold and the offbeat.

        <h2>Founded in Bahrain</h2>
        <p>
          From a tiny Gulf island, we launched a brand with global resonance. 
          Rooted in Middle Eastern grit and creativity, we’ve grown into a platform for expression and design without borders.

          We don’t follow trends—we build stories. Each collection is a canvas where art meets apparel, 
          infused with detail, emotion, and unexpected twists that set us apart.

          You’re the reason we exist. You are The Odd Sheep.
